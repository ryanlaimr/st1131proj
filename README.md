This statistical report is the final project for _ST1131 Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Programming_. In this report, I fitted a linear regression model using RStudio to predict the house price of Oregon, USA from various factors.

In this project, I explored the effectiveness of each regressor in the given dataset and purposed the optimal combination of regressors for regression model utilizing statistical plots and t-test.
